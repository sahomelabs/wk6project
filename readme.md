What is Blackjack?
Blackjack, also known as 21, is a classic and widely played card game in casinos and homes worldwide. It's a game that combines skill, strategy, and a bit of luck. The primary objective is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.


// Key Concepts:
Card Values: In Blackjack, the cards' values are as follows:
    * Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.
    * Face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) are each worth 10 points.
    * Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points, depending on which value benefits the player.


//The Deal: Blackjack is typically played with one or more standard decks of 52 cards. Players receive two cards initially, and the dealer gets one card face up and one face down.


//The Objective: Is to get a hand value of 21 or closer to it than the dealer without going over 21. If you go over 21, you "bust" and lose the round.
Gameplay:
    * Hit: To request another card to increase your hand's total.
    * Stand: To keep your current hand and end your turn.
    * Double Down: To double your initial bet and receive one additional card.
    * Split: If you have two cards of the same rank, you can split them into two separate hands and play them independently.

Winning: You win if your hand's total is closer to 21 than the dealer's, or if the dealer busts. A natural Blackjack, an Ace and a 10-value card, usually pays 3:2.

Basic Strategy: Learning basic Blackjack strategy is essential for maximizing your chances of winning. This involves making the best decisions based on your hand and the dealer's upcard.
